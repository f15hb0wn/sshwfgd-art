# Atsugi Era
VFA-192 was based in CVW-5 at NAF Atsugi Japan until 2009. During that time, the Squadron's logo was modified to have a dragon wrapped around the Asian Pacific.

## Ballcap for Atsugi Era
Designers were contracted to recreated the ballcap design used during that period. The design files are intended for embroidery on Navy Ballcaps for Dragon Veterans from that time and fans of the BBSOB's of VFA-192.
The finalized design files are in the `ballcap` folder.
